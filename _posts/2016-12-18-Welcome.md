Programming Chi (or Qi) is a blog about pitiful ideas, bugs and failures I notice every day.
Fortunately, besides failures there are also a lot of successes and beautiful solution which I hope I will also write about.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi):

> In traditional Chinese culture, qì or ch'i (About this sound qì, also known as khí in Vietnamese culture, 
gi in Korean culture, ki in Japanese culture) is an active principle forming part of any living thing. 
Qi literally translates as "breath", "air", or "gas", and figuratively as "material energy", "life force", 
or "energy flow". Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts.
