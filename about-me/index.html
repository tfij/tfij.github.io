<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
    Unfortunately I'm neither a rock star nor a president of a nuclear empire.
    Frankly speaking "about me" is the most boring part of this blog.
    Let's just get this over.

    Hi, my name is Tomek Fija≈Çkowski.
    In my career, I've performed a variety of roles including Scrum master and tech leader.
    Currently, I'm a Senior Software Engineer in point72.
