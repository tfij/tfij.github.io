<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Unfortunately I'm neither a rock star nor a president of a nuclear empire.
Frankly speaking "about me" is the most boring part of this blog.
Let's just get this over.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Tomek Fija≈Çkowski. In my career, I've performed a variety of roles including Scrum master and tech leader.
Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer in <a href="http://allegro.pl" target="_blank">allegro.pl</a> company.</p>

<p>My occasional activity in the Java community manifested, for example, by leading workshop at
<a href="http://warsjawa.pl" target="_blank">Warsjawa</a> giving a talk at
<a href="http://confitura.pl" target="_blank">Confitura</a> conference.</p>
